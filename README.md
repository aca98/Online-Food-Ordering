# Online-Food-Ordering
Univerisity Project

Note: The reason why customers can see the same thing as the employees, is because the application was built to quickly show the work with the database, for this project the application part wasn't important, 
since the project main focus is on the database and the application part was optional. But i decided to do the application part anyway, in order to test my skills with Spring Boot and Spring MVC.

Application for managing an online food ordering business. Customers can order products, while employees can add, remove and update the products.
Employees can add new employees and remove existing ones.

In order to run the application the users must have Microsoft SQL Server installed, next the user must execute the contents of the file "Database.sql" in Microsoft SQL Server
in order to build the database, next the user must add a nother login to the database with the username "test" and password "test" and SQL Server authentication turned on.

After launching the application the user must execute the maven install(mvn install) command in order to download all the dependencies.
